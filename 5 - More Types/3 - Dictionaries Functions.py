# Just like lists, dictionary keys can be assigned to different values.
# However, unlike lists, a new dictionary key can also be assigned a value,
# not just ones that already exist.

squares = {1: 1, 2:4, 3: "error", 4: 16,}
squares[8] = 64
squares[3] = 9
print(squares)

# To determine whether a key is in a dictionary, you can use in and not in,
# just as you can for a list.
# Example:

nums = {
1: "one",
2: "two",
3: "three",
}

print(1 in nums)
print("three" in nums)
print(4 not in nums)

# A useful dictionary method is get. It does the same thing as indexing, but if
# the key is not found in the dictionary it returns another specified value instead
# ('None', by default).
# Example:

pairs = {
1: "apple",
"orange": [2, 3, 4],
True: False,
None: "True",
}

print(pairs.get("orange"))
print(pairs.get(7))
print(pairs.get(12345, "not in dictionary"))
